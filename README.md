# hello-flutter
Getting started with Flutter.

This project is a simple Counter, but the initial number to count from is inserted by the user. To do this, I used:

* State Management
* Routing: navigate between screens
* Routing: send data to new screen

### Screens

1. The Home page with a simple "Hello" greeting;
2. The "Enter number" screen, where the user should insert the number that he/she wants to start counting from;
3. The "Counter" screen, where's the actual counting.

The counter only adds or subtracts 1 from the target number. The goal isn't to complex anything, only to get started with important Flutter concepts.
